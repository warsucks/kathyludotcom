			<p>HELLOOO! I'm Kathy.
			I like engineering, comics, and improv. I'm currently a software engineer at Two Sigma in New York City. </p>

			<p>I grew up in Michigan--a land of lakes, frozen fingers in the winter, and lightning bugs in the summer.
			I studied Biomedical Engineering and Industrial Engineering at the University of Michigan ('12 and '13, respectively). Then I lived in Berlin for two years and ate mostly Asian food (pho, dumplings, pad thai) there. </p>
